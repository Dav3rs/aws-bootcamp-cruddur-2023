# Week 0 â€” Billing and Architecture

## Required Homework
- I created a user on IAM, then created a user-group named 'Administrator' with the full access permissions, and then added my new user to the group.
- I have created a napkin in Lucid Charts and then a more curated architectural diagram.
- I created a billing alarm and played around the aws pricing calculator.
- I researched about pricing diferences of the available options for deploying containers on aws.
- I used EventBridge to hookup the health dashboard to sns.
- I watched all the videos of the bootcamp playlist for the week 0
- I generated aws key credentials to use from cli.
